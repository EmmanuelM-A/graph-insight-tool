# Requirements Specification

## Project Overview

The AI Graph Generation and Insight Tool is a web-based application that enables users 
to upload tabular data and receive a graph that best visualizes the data and optionally
some automated insights. The system aims to democratize data visualization by making it 
accessible to users without prior data analysis experience.
